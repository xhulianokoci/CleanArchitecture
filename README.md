# Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core

This repository implements a robust solution following the principles of **Clean Architecture** using **ASP.NET Core**. It emphasizes separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability, making it an ideal choice for enterprise-level applications.

## Key Concepts of Clean Architecture

The project is structured into multiple layers to promote a clean and testable codebase:

1. **Core Layer**:
   - Contains business logic and domain models.
   - Independent of any external frameworks or technologies.

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Implements use cases and application logic.
   - Handles communication between the Core and Infrastructure layers.

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Manages external concerns like database access, API calls, and logging.
   - Implements repositories and integrations.

4. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Defines the user interface or API endpoints.
   - Serves as the entry point for user interaction.
